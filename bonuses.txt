BONUS CHALLENGE FORM
--------------------

For each bonus challenge you have implemented, please replace the sentence "We are not entitled to this bonus."
with a short description of:

1.⁠ ⁠How it was implemented in your code
2.⁠ ⁠Where it was used (in which class methods).
3.⁠ ⁠How you tested that it is working correctly.

--------------------

1.⁠ ⁠Fully supporting all configuration fields and avoiding the use of magic numbers

1.⁠ ⁠we updated the size of inComingActions to be featureSize. Instead of using actual numbers (3 for set, 12 for number of slots, etc.) we used the corresponding features in the Config file.
2.⁠ ⁠Supporting features- we used tableSize (Player class- ArtificialInteligence, Dealer- PlaceCardsOnTable, placeAllSlots, removeAllCardsFromTable, Table-Constructor) and featureSize(Player class-Constructor, run, ChosenSlots-convertToSet, setVecToArr)
3.⁠ ⁠we changed the relevent features' values in the Config file.


--------------------

2.⁠ ⁠Terminating all threads (that you created) gracefully and in reverse order to the order they were created in.

1.⁠ ⁠First, we Terminated Players threads in reverse order and than delaer thread.
2.⁠ ⁠In terminate methods in delaer and player class.
3.⁠ ⁠When each Thread was created/terminated we printed a message.



--------------------

3.⁠ ⁠Handling the config.turnTimeoutMillis value as follows:
config.turnTimeoutMillis < 0: display nothing.
config.turnTimeoutMillis = 0: display a timer since the last action (reshuffle or set collected).
Note: in modes without a countdown timer the dealer must ensure there is always at least one legal set on the table.

We are not entitled to this bonus.

4.⁠ ⁠Making sure that the threads do not wake up unless some actual job needs to be done (e.g., a value needs to be
changed on the display, key input needs to be handled, etc.) and the only threads created by you are:
1 thread per player + 1 additional thread for non-human players.
